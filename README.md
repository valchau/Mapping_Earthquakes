# Mapping_Earthquakes
module 14
## Basic Project Plan
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Tasks
To complete this project, I used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then I added the data to a map to allow visualization.

### Approach
My approach is to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. I also used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
